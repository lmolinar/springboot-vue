Hi, thanks for stopping by.

I use this to study some technologies I might be interested in or to test things in combination.

I might as well decide to do some blog posts here inspired by [Scott Hanselman](https://www.hanselman.com).

This is developed with [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/).

It runs Tomcat as a web server using spring boot. (Which is not really used in the project so far).

Then everything goes into docker container and I deploy at the cloud.

Source code is [here](https://github.com/pablosaraiva/springboot-vue).

Soon I will work on the delivery pipeline.
